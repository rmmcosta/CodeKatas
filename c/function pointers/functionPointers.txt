in function pointers the name, or should we say identifier, goes in the middle.
to read a declaration for a function pointer we must follow the right left rule.


int *(*foo)(int,int,int);

we start in the middle with the identifier
identifier: foo
we look right
right: nothing
we look left
left: pointer
we look right:
right: funtion that takes 3 ints
we look left:
left: return int* (a pointer to an int)

foo is a pointer to a function that takes 3 ints and returns an int pointer
